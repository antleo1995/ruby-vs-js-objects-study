# Ruby vs. JavaScript: Objects Study

There's no distinction between objects and key-value pairs (a.k.a. associative
arrays, a.k.a. dictionaries, a.k.a. hashes) in JavaScript. In fact, JavaScript
objects look and behave similarly to Ruby hashes. However, Ruby hashes behave
differently from JavaScript objects.

## Prerequisites

-   General Assembly Boston: JavaScript Series
    -   [JavaScript Reference Types](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-reference-types)
    -   [JavaScript Objects: Modeling](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-objects-modeling)
    -   [JavaScript Objects: Referencing Own Properties](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-objects-this)
    -   [JavaScript Constructors](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-objects-constructors)
    -   [JavaScript Prototypes](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-objects-prototypes)
-   General Assembly Boston: Ruby vs. JavaScript Series
    -   [Ruby vs. JavaScript](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js)
    -   [Ruvy (Hash) vs. JavaScript (Dictionary)](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-hash-dictionary)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Compare and Contrast Ruby objects and JavaScript objects.
-   Define a class for an object in Ruby that assigns attributes in the
    constructor.
-   Create an instance of an object in Ruby using the `new` method.
-   Write setter and getter instance methods for Ruby objects and JavaScript
    objects.
